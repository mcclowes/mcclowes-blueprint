# mcclowes-blueprint

A blueprint for understanding me, my quirks, and my priorities.

TL;DR: Remove fear from the future so we can be confident today.

Values

1. I value experimentation
    1. Delivering full features is a given. But it’s important to think about where that next story is coming from. Often your devs know/use the product more than anyone else. There’s some much that just cannot emerge from top-down ideation.
    2. This means looking at the new/state-of-the-art, learning, and implementing.
    3. Though this is not just trying out new frameworks
2. Understanding
    1. Understand as much as you can now, and understand what you dont know so you can measure it in the future
    2. Frtom a product perspective, obvs that means me testing assumptions before I get devs to build something, and defining measurable metrics for after delivery
    3. This means look at the new and ignoring it because it’s not appropriate
    4. You wan’t to implement TS? Why? It’s going to add 15%+ extra time to features. It’s not mission critical that we have no broken pages. Why?
3. Establishing process
    1. Scalability in the future is based on establishing process today that will serve the future
    2. When you change pace (e.g. startup → scale up or hitting a new market) it happens overnight
    3. For you guys, that probably means investing in testing, automation, dependency management, solid/speedy ci
4. Two-way doors, stepping stones minimising debt
    1. We all make mistakes. Mistakes are ok. Ensuring we can reverse those mistakes is key.
    2. Stepping stones - MVPs that serve the future, not the nearest path
    3. Tech debt is  important - it may seems like building something in .5x time is ‘agile’ but if it will take the  2x the time to remove that shoddy implementation or to turn it into the full feature, that’s no good, because then it never becomes priority

This may read like caution. I am not a cautious person. None of the above should block delivering our product. I’m an experimenter, and I know that experiments are rarely successful, so this is all about removing fear of the future so we can be confident today.

Summary:

- Understand all the tools at our disposal
- Only use tools that make sense for us
- Set in place processes that will save us time tomorrow
- Understand what we’re building and give it the time it deserves so we don’t have to rebuild i
