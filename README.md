A blueprint for understanding me, my quirks, and my priorities.

**TL;DR:** Remove fear from the future so we can be confident today.


## Work

### Announce and Act

For anything we can readily undo, let people know what you're going to do then do it. No asking permission, no asking forgiveness.

## Product Management

### Insight

#### Track everything 

Track things and look at that data. Understand what you can't track today so you can measure it in the future. If a feature's success can't be measured, we're not doing it.

#### Use the product

Data is no substitute to actually experiencing the product first hand.

#### Everyone's a user

Devs know & use the product more than anyone else. There’s some much that just cannot emerge from top-down ideation. This means looking at the new/state-of-the-art, learning, and implementing. Though this is not just trying out new frameworks

### Decisions

#### Stepping stones

__Build MVPs that serve the future, not the nearest path__

Every piece of work 

#### Two-way doors

We all make mistakes. Mistakes are ok. Ensuring we can reverse those mistakes is key.

### Process

#### Establishing process

__Set in place processes that will save us time tomorrow__

Scalability in the future is based on establishing process today that will serve the future. When you change pace (e.g. startup → scale up or hitting a new market) it happens overnight. For devs, that also means investing in testing, automation, dependency management, solid/speedy CI.

### Prioritisation

#### MVP = Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)

__Even an MVP has to be loveable__

I see people scoping out work from an MVP mindset focusing on core functionalities, neglecting form and delightful functionality and leading to poor user experience. A product with a poor experience is inherently non-viable.

#### Experimentation

Delivering full features is a given, but it’s important to think about where that next story is coming from. 

#### Avoid debt

Building something in half the expected time feels like moving fast, but unpicking a shoddy implementation or developing a crude MVP into a full feature feels very slow. Be realistic: debt rarely gets addressed once introduced.
