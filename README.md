A blueprint for understanding me, my quirks, and my priorities.

**TL;DR:** Remove fear from the future so we can be confident today.

## Understanding

1. If it cant be tracked, we're not doing it
2. Tracking - understand what you dont know so you can measure it in the future
3. Everyone's a user
Devs know/use the product more than anyone else. There’s some much that just cannot emerge from top-down ideation. This means looking at the new/state-of-the-art, learning, and implementing. Though this is not just trying out new frameworks

## Decisions

1. **Stepping stones** - Build MVPs that serve the future, not the nearest path
Every piece of work 

4. **Two-way doors** - 
We all make mistakes. Mistakes are ok. Ensuring we can reverse those mistakes is key.

## Process

1. **Establishing process** - Set in place processes that will save us time tomorrow

Scalability in the future is based on establishing process today that will serve the future. When you change pace (e.g. startup → scale up or hitting a new market) it happens overnight. For devs, that also means investing in testing, automation, dependency management, solid/speedy CI.

## Prioritisation

1. **MVP = Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)** - Even an MVP has to be loveable
I see people scoping out work from an MVP mindset focusing on core functionalities, neglecting form and delightful functionality and leading to poor user experience. A product with a poor experience is inherently non-viable.

2. **Experimentation ** - 
Delivering full features is a given, but it’s important to think about where that next story is coming from. 

3. **Avoid debt** - 
Building something in half the expected time feels like moving fast, but unpicking a shoddy implementation or developing a crude MVP into a full feature feels very slow. Be realistic: debt rarely gets addressed once introduced.
